## Overview

After updating to 
[Ubuntu Mate 22.04](https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/),
I had to redo some of my virtual environments because Python 3.9 was replaced
with 3.10.
I remembered an article from 
[Real Python](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv)
that went through support multiple versions of Python.
While that part is useful, using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) can
help keep up to date with the latest Python as well as support virtual
environments.

This article will go through how I use pyenv and my plans to update my workflow
using it.

## Current Workflow

Currently I use `venv` to manage my virtual environments.
For the most part this works fine as I have alias `ae` to activate and `de` to
deactivate in Linux (as long as the folder is `venv`).
For Windows, I still use `venv` but I don't have any aliases as I put the
Python version and whether I am using 32 or 64 bits.

For managing different Python versions, for Windows I just go to 
[Python's official website](https://python.org) and download a new version when
I need to.
I put all my installs in `c:\python` and name the folders by version and either
it is 32 or 64 bits.
In Linux, initially I was using whatever came in the package manager.
Then I wanted to have a newer version so I used
[Deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).
This works okay but can break when I update Ubuntu.

## Setting up pyenv

For the most part [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) does a good job.
[Real Python](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv)
does a great job setting it up and how to use `pyenv` in Linux or Mac.

For Windows, I am going to use
[pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win).
Since I use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), will use `choco install
pyenv-win` to get pyenv.
The downside of Windows, `pyenv-win` doesn't support `virtualenv` plugin like
`pyenv`.

## Using pyenv

Now I can create a virtual environment for `example_project` and went I go to
that folder, it will automatically switch to that environment.

    $ mkdir example_project
    $ cd example_project
    $ pyenv virtualenv 3.9.7 example_project
    $ pyenv local example_project

`pyenv` creates a `.python_version` file with the name of either the virtual
environment or the python version.

Windows would be slightly different.

    $ mkdir example_project
    $ cd example_project
    $ pyenv local 3.9.7
    $ python3 -m venv venv39-64
    $ venv\Scripts\activate.bat

## Summary

My plan is to apply this to both my personal and professional projects.
The nice part is that `pyenv` creates `.python_version` so even if I decide to
use something else, I will know which Python version I was using.
Also using `pyenv` to manage my Python versions, I can keep certain projects on
an older Python version while using the newest version to try out new features.

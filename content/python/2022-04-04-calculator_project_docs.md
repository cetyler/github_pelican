## Overview

From the 
[previous article]({filename}/python/2022-04-03-calculator_project_cli.md),
the plan is to create [calculator](https://github.com/cetyler/calculator) in
order to update my Python workflow.
This article will cover the documentation.

## Code Documentation

At minimum each class and function should have some level of documentation to
describe what it does.
For this project, I will do enough documentation that will benefit an initial
package release.

Using an IDE like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use an
extension [autoDocstring](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring) to
auto generate the docstring.
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) also has 
[vim-pydocstring](https://github.com/heavenshell/vim-pydocstring) to auto
generate the docstring.

## README

At minimum the README should describe how to install the program and brief
explanation how to run the program.
Simple programs/libraries can get away with just having the README as the only
documentation.

For this project, I want the README to describe the following:

- What is this program.

- How to install.

- A link to the article series.

- How to find and build the documentation.

    - Since I am not going to create my documentation at
      [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), I want to explain how to
      create the documentation.

I generally treat READMEs for other developers not necessarily for the users of
the program.

## Generating Documentation with Sphinx

While I am not going to publish the documentation, for this project I will
generate some minimal documentation to verify the process.

Documentation will be generated by Sphinx so that I can provide information for
users and developer.
Also I can provide information of the API by pulling the docstrings from the
classes and functions.

## Using Gitea/Github Wiki

I am currently using https://github.com/cetyler/calculator/wiki for User
Requirements and Design Requirements.
If I planned on publishing the documentation, I may put the User Requirements
in Sphinx instead.

I think for simple projects like the calculator project, it makes sense to have
a README and use the Wiki instead of creating a more structured documentation.

## Next Steps

Some basic documentation is done.
The next article will build the package (not to pypi) to verify that the
package will work.

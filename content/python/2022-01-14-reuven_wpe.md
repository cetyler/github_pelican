Summary: Review of Reuven's Weekly Python Exercise A3.
Status: published

## Overview

I recently completed Reuven Lerner's
[Weekly Python Exercise](https://store.lerner.co.il/wpe) A3 which focused on
Object-oriented Python.
I took this course around the same time as
[Reuven's OOP self pace course]({filename}/python/2022-01-08-reuven_oop.md).
I wasn't sure which course would click more with me, so I took both.

Weekly Python Exercise (WPE) is a 15 week course where Reuven provides an
exercise a week by email and provides the solution the following week.

## Course Topics

Taken from Reuven's Overview:

WPE A3 covers object-oriented programming, for beginning Python developers.
It'll cover:

- Defining classes and instances
- Defining methods
- Composition of objects
- Keeping track of shared state among instances
- Inheritance
- Basic "magic" methods, such as `__str__` and `__len__`
- Class methods

I did not take A1 (basic data structures) or A2 (functions and modules).

## Impressions

New exercises are posted on Tuesdays with the solutions on Monday.
Reuven includes a `pytest` file to check your work.
The exercises build on each other and he uses 3 different things to build on
(ex. homes in a neighborhood).
In the exercises, he would also include links to more information that may help
solve the problem.
He also introduced type hints and `mypy`.
For me this was extremely helpful understanding how I could use `mypy`
initially to get some basic checks and `pytest` to help round out testing.
I was already using `pytest` and `flake8` but I never really used `mypy`.

There is a forum where Reuven and the other students can use.
There wasn't a ton of interaction with the other students though it was useful
to see how they would solve the problem after I posted mine.
Reuven would also post some suggestions or comments but the activity started to
drop off after about 6-7 weeks.

The live office hours (through Zoom) I went to all but maybe one due to a
scheduling conflict.
Most of the time there were about an hour long based on whatever questions
people emailed ahead a time or what was asked during the meeting.
The meetings were helpful for the exercises but it was also helpful understand
when to use type hints or how to think about using classes.

## Conclusion

Overall I think it was a good beginner course on Object-orient programming
using Python.
For me it was a good value as I purchased the course through Humble Bundle
Python Super Power Bundle.
If I could only do one course, I would pick this over the self pace online
course.
Having the ability to talk with Reuven, how he included tests and type hints
make this 15 week course a better value.
However, I am glad that I had the opportunity to do both.
Both courses have different styles which gave me a couple of different
viewpoints.

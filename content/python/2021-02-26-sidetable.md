Chris Moffit at [Practical Business Pyton](https://pbpython.com) created a
pandas utility library called [sidetable](https://pbpython.com/sidetable.html).
I have played with it a little bit not with any real project yet.

The benefit I can see is that if it can accelerate my initial analysis.
My plan is to do a personal project before using for a work project.

I plan on updating this post once I use it at some point.

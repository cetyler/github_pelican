## Overview

[pdb++](https://github.com/pdbpp/pdbpp) is a drop in replacement for the pdb
module of the standard library.
Using pdb++ can help with debugging your python programs.

This article with be a short introduction using a simple program to show the
difference between pdb and pdb++.

## Inventory Program

The program will return inventory on all racks or just a single rack location.
There will also have a couple of tests to ensure that it works.
This will enable us to use the debugger either running tests or running the
program.
The program has an `Inventory` class with some classes to handle errors.

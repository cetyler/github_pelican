Summary: Review of Reuven's OOP Python self pace course.
Status: published

## Overview

I recently completed Reuven Lerner's
[Object-orient Python](https://store.lerner.co.il/object-oriented-python) self
pace course.
My goal was to better understand how to do OOP using Python.
For context, I know of OOP but never could understand it well enough to use in
my programs.

## Course Topics

Taken from Reuven's Overview:

Through numerous video lessons and exercises, this course will teach you what
you need in order to take advantage of Python's objects. I cover such topics
as:

- What is an object?
- Setting and retrieving attributes
- Creating classes
- The role of `__init__`
- The role of self
- Writing and calling methods
- Attribute search, and why we care
- Class attributes
- Inheritance

## Impressions

First of all I like the self pace nature and that Reuven provided the Jupyter
Notebook and slides.
Also the videos are a manageable length around 15 minutes.
The first 6 sections I was able to work on a section a week.
The summary project was a little quicker since there was only one video which
gave me more time to complete the final project.

The exercises build on each other.
Reuven used a couple different things to model like a bank account, ice cream,
etc.
The final exercise did a good job covering most of what Reuven covered in the
course.
I felt comfortable with the knowledge that I learn to complete the exercise.

This course does not include tests to verify your work instead there are
solution videos.
I believe there were not tests since I think Reuven assumes that you will
also be using Jupyter Notebooks to work through the exercises.
I instead created Python scripts and ran in the console.
The final exercise, I created tests using pytest to ensure that I met the
requirements.

## Conclusion

Overall I think it was a good beginner course on Object-orient programming
using Python.
For me it was a good value as I purchased the course through Humble Bundle
Python Super Power Bundle.
This course was the first time that OOP clicked for me and the way I think.
Finally I just simply enjoyed Reuven's teaching style.

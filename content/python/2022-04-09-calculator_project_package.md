## Overview

From the 
[previous article]({filename}/python/2022-04-04-calculator_project_docs.md),
the plan is to create [calculator](https://github.com/cetyler/calculator) in
order to update my Python workflow.
This article will cover creating a Python package.

## Using Flit

Instead of using ``setup.py``, I will be using flit instead.
While this project won't go on PyPi, it will go to my internal PyPi server.
Will use [my article]({filename}/python/2021-04-17-create_package.md) to build my
package.

The main reason I want to continue to use flit is that it only creates and
publishes packages.

## Next Steps

While the calculator project is not complete, it did the job in going through
the process of creating a Python project.
The next article I will create a checklist to update Audrey's cookiecutter.

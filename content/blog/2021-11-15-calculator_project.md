Summary: Switch from Jekyll to Pelican.
Status: draft

## Overview

I was reviewing how I currently create my Python projects and libraries and
realized that I need to clean up my process.
The plan to create a simple calculator project.
This project can be used as both a project and a standalone program.

## Roadmap

There will be two paths; working on the calculator itself and creating a
workflow.

### Calculator

- Create User Requirements.
- Create Design Requirements.
- Create README.
- Create Roadmap.
- Create tests.
- Create initial release.
- Finish roadmap.

### Workflow

Pretty much document every part while creating the calculator project.
In addition, will also do the following:

- Document what is the minimum required for documentation.
- Document the process to setup the project.
- Document what is the minimum required for testing.
- Document add the Python package to PyPi.

## Conclusion

The goal is to use a simple project to help create a consistent workflow that I
can use for my personal and professional projects.
Ideally, use something like Cookiecutter to help create consistent projects.

I did buy [Talk Python Modern Python Projects
Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/modern-python-projects) and will
update my workflow based on the training.

Summary: Use SQL on top of pandas!
Status: draft
comment_id: efficient-sql-pandas-duckdb

While watching 
[PythonBytes #235](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/flask-2.0-articles-and-reactions),
I found out about [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/2021/05/14/sql-on-pandas.html) by
Mark and Hannes.
I am curious since I use pandas quite a bit but still struggle to remember the
syntax.
If I could just run SQL queries on top of pandas, maybe that would cover 95% of
what I do.

I plan on going through some data and seeing how well this can work.

## Setup and get the data

I WON'T USE A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
TRY AND FIND A FUN DATASET.

## EDA

## Compare to SQLite

LOOK AT DUMPING DATA INTO SQLITE FIRST THEN JUST PERFORMING THE QUERIES INSTEAD

## Conclusion

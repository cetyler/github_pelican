Instead of posting on Twitter or LinkedIn, my goal is to use this website to
post interesting articles that either I found else where or things that I am
working on.

With my current job, I do mainly do data analyzing using Python with the Pandas
library.
I have been also PostgreSQL to store my data for further analysis.

My next posts will mainly be problems that I was able to solve with Python.

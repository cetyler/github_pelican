Summary: My python project workflow.

After listening to
[Talk Python to Me #314](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/314/ask-us-about-modern-python-projects-and-tools),
I decided that I need to update my Python workflow.
I am leaning towards buying
[Modern Python Projects Course](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/modern-python-projects)
but will probably wait until later in the year when I have some more time.

This post will focus on my workflow on Python projects and packages.
I have a separate workflow for my data analysis.

## History

When I started using Python more regularly, I realized that I needed a process
so that I could create consistent folder structure, keep track of my packages,
etc.
I was already using Git but I started using
[cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) and Python venv virtual
environments.
However I went crazy on my cookiecutter template and made it overly complicated
and I had difficulty upgrading packages without breaking something.
The last 6 months I have really started to look at my tools and make
improvements.

I believe my biggest issue was that I did not really sit down and figure out my
requirements and the minimum I need to get a project going.
I am hoping that documenting will help me continuously improve my workflow.

## Code Editor

I actually use couple different IDEs/editors.
With all my editors, I put my settings/config file in a git repo so that I can
share with all my computers.

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

There is a lot of momentum with a lot of people using VS Code.
There is great Python support and more importantly VS Code works on Windows,
Linux and Mac. VS Code supports a variety of languages as well.
This makes learning one IDE that works everywhere and with most languages.

I use VS Code mainly at work and not much at home despite that I can use it
everywhere.
VS Code is a little heavy and can get slow if you use too many plugins.
Also I lean more towards more to the command-line.
VS Code does have a neat feature to sync settings across multiple computers.

However I readily suggest VS Code when others ask since it is pretty easy to use
and it is pretty popular.

### [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io)

This replaced vim for me.
Micro is as easy as nano and almost as powerful as vim.
Micro is a terminal-based editor which could be a turn off to some.
Micro does support plugins and with Python it supports syntax highlighting,
linting, auto indenting, etc.

I use micro at home and at work though at work only on my Ubuntu VM.
Micro for Windows is slow while using in Windows Terminal.
Using micro under WSL works fine though.

**Note** that micro is not an IDE but with plugin could be consider a
lightweight IDE.

## Running Multiple Python Versions

I currently have different methods based on OS.

### Windows

For right now, I download packages from https://python.org and install 
`c:\python\pythonXX-VV` with `XX` being the Python version and `VV` whether it is
32-bit or 64-bit.
The problem with this is that I need to keep on top of minor Python updates.

### Linux

I primarily use Debian based distros.
Right now I am using the versions that are in the package manager.
My plan is to migrate to [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) though I don't
have a current use.

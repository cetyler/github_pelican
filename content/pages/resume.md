## Education 

### Carnegie Mellon University

#### Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering

Researcher on the MDMS project (Modular Distributed Manipulated System which was
an array of motor setups, each setup have two motors to move an object in 2D
motion with a video camera to locate the object.
Shower Temperature Regulator to maintain uniform water was my senior design
team project.
Ford Mustang Analysis Senior Case Study examined three prototype Mustangs to
determine which one would be the most cost effective and quickest to fix.

- Researcher: Redesigned the motor setup to accommodate larger motors and added
  a suspension system on MDMS project using ProEngineer to create 
  professional-grade CAD drawings for the machinists

- Ford Mustang Analysis Case Study: Researched and ranked 14 different
  changeable settings and analyzed skid pad data to determine which prototype
  exhibited over-steer

- Shower Temperature Regulator: Analyzed fluid flow and water mixing properties
  with Mathcad and designed user interface

## Python

### [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

If you don't know much about Python or would like to get a good foundation,
reading Al's books can be a great start.
I have read Automate the Boring Stuff and it helped me early on to get Python to
help me with my job.
My initial program was using a Raspberry Pi to control relays to have 
discharge batteries.
My next project at work I was able to convert HEX logs and convert to a human
readable format.
These initial projects I was able to do using Al's books.

### [Practical Business Python](https://pbpython.com/)

I have found that Chris' articles have been very helpful in using Python for my
job.
I highly recommend signing up for the newsletter or using RSS.
His articles helped me improve my skills using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to
do data analysis and present that data to the rest of my team.

### [Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

A great resource to get information through tutorials and training.
Very helpful to narrow down which Python packages to use or to get a good
overview over programming concepts.
I have purchased a couple of training courses which was beyond the beginner
level training.

### [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/)

Initially found Michael's website by listening to his podcasts.
I have brought multiple of his training courses which has helped round out my
Python knowledge.

## Database

### [Memorable SQL](https://payhip.com/b/oXJs)

Jeff's book does a good job providing a good intro to SQL.
He uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which prior to reading his
book, I thought it was too much effort to use a proper database.
While [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) has it uses, using PostgreSQL
enabled me to have my data at work on the server and I can access it from 
multiple PCs.

Jeff provides enough detail to do meaningful queries and shows how to create
and structure a database.
